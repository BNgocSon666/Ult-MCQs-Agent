## 📘 Ultimate MCQs Agent: User Guide

Welcome! This system is designed to help you turn any document or audio file into a complete quiz (also called an "exam").

This guide is split into two parts:
1.  **For Creators:** The person who uploads files, creates questions, and builds exams (e.g., a teacher, a manager).
2.  **For Takers:** The person who receives a link to take an exam (e.g., a student, an employee, or a guest).

This is your main control panel. Here’s how to go from a document to a shareable exam.

### 1. Getting Started (Sign Up & Log In)
First, you need an account.
* **Register:** On the login page, click "Sign up now". Enter your username, email, and password.
* **Log In:** Use your new account to log in. You will be taken to your main Dashboard.

### 2. Step 1: Create Questions (The AI Agent)
This is where you feed your content to the AI.
1.  From the Dashboard, you'll be on the **"Create (AI)"** tab.

3.  Choose the number of questions you want.
4.  Click **"Start Generation"**.

The system will now read your file and use AI to generate questions.

### 3. Step 2: Review and Edit the AI's Work
A pop-up window will appear with the AI's results.
